sind die Gesamtheit  von Regeln oder Richtlinien, \ndie bei der Verfassung des Quellcodes eines Computerprogramms in einer \nbestimmten Programmiersprache verwendet werden, die vorschreiben, welche \nbestimmten Praktiken und Methoden für jeden Teil eines Programms in der \nbestimmten Sprache verwendet werden sollen. Zweck der Kodierungskonventionen \nist abzusichern, dass der Quellcodex so geschrieben ist, dass sowohl seine\nLesbarkeit als auch seine Wartungsmöglichkeit verbessert wird \n([1], [2],\n[3], [4], [5]).\nDie Gesamtheit der Regeln, die beim Verfassen des Quellcodes gelten, können in 4 Bereiche geordnet werden [4]:\n[6].\n\">Η ταξινόμηση του προγραμματιστικού στυλ [6].\n\n\nTypographische Stile: Regeln ,die mit der Anordnung und Erscheinung des\nQuellcodes sowie Kommentarverwendung zu tun haben, aber nicht mit der\nProgrammausführung. \nGenerelle Programmierpraktiken: Regeln und Richtlinien bezüglich der\nMethodologie und Sprache, die verwendet werden und den Quellcodex beeinflussen. \nKontrollstrukturen: Regeln bezüglich der Algorithmennutzung und \n-realisierung.\nInformationsstrukturen: Regeln bezüglich von Datenstrukturen, \nProgrammfluss sowie Datenspeicherung und -behandlung. \n\nIn dieser Arbeit werden die zwei ersten Themen entwickelt werden (Typographischer Stil und Generelle Programmierpraktiken). Diese Richtlinien dienen zur strukturellen Softwarequalität 1 (Engl. Software structural quality)\nEs kommt oft das Argument vor, wenn einer Kodierungskonvention gefolgt wird, \nkann sie beim Lesen und Verständnis des Quellcodes (helfen) und noch mehr bei \nder Fehlervermeidung und der Qualitätsbesserung des Quellcodes helfen ([3], ([7], \n([8], ([9]). \n[9].\">Η σχέση μεταξύ προγραμματιστικού στυλ και ποιότητας λογισμικού \n[9].\nDie Vereinbarungen, die erfolgen, wenn einer bestimmten Kodierungskonvention\ngefolgt wird, helfen  nur den Programmquellcodewärtern und -korrektoren. Die\nKodierungskonventionen werden vom Compiler nicht auferlegt. So hat ein Programm,\ndas manche oder alle Regeln nicht befolgt, keinen Einfluss auf die ausführbare\nProgrammdatei, die vom Quellcode geschaffen wurde\n([1],[2]).\nDer Verfassungsstil ist ein Element, das oft übersehen wird, aber er ist\nein sehr kritisches Merkmal der Kodierungskonventionen. Der Kodierungsstil\nbeeinflusst direkt die Wiedererkennbarkeit und Verständnis des Endprodukts.\nEbenso auch die Kodierungskonventionen, die das Quellcodeverfassen in einer\nProgrammsprache ist, leiden auch an diesem Übersehen. Die Programme müssen \nlesbar und verständlich sein, nicht nur von den Maschinen sondern auch vom \nMenschen. Diese Forderung ist wichtig für die Herstellung von qualitativen\nProdukten, die nicht nur den Benutzerbedürfnissen entsprechen, sondern sie \nkönnen auch innerhalb eines Zeitplanes und vorberechneten  Kosten entwickelt \nwerden. Das wirksame Quellcodeverfassen ist schon seit langer Zeit untersucht\nworden, d.h. seit den ersten vorhandenen Programmsprachen, wie Fortan \n[10] aber es ist immer noch ein Brennpunkt  - eine \nwichtige Frage ([3],[Citation not found]). \nDer Programmierungsstil, der in einem Programm gebraucht wird, können auf \nden Kodierungskonventionen beruhen, die eine Firma oder ein anderer Träger\ngemacht hat, die sich mit dem Quellcodeverfassen beschäftigt (z.B. \n[11], [12],\n[13], [14],\n[15], [16],\n[17]}) sowie die Vorlieben des Autors selbst. \nEs gibt zahlreiche Schriftkonventionen, die gebraucht werden, um einen \nkonsequenten  Code  sicherzustellen. Die Schriftkonventionen sind für die\nSoftwareentwickler sehr wichtig, denn sie können ziemlich viele Vorteile \nanbieten wie ([18], \n[1], [19]):\n\nSoftware-Wartung (Engl. Software maintenance):Softwarewartung \nrepräsentiert mindestens 50% der Softwaredauerkosten ([4], \nwährend in anderen Forschungen steht, dass 40% bis 80% der \nSoftwaredauerkosten für die Softwarewartung ausgegeben werden\n(([20], ([1]). \nDie Wartungskostenreduzierung ist der häufigst genannte Grund für den \nGebrauch der Kodierungskonventionen. Fast kein Programm wird vom \nanfänglichen Schöpfer erhalten-gewartet. So helfen diese \nKodierungskonventionen beim besseren.\n\nSoftwarequalität (Engl. Software quality): Die Codeevaluierung\nund -verbesserung schließt oft das Quellcodelesen von Dritten ein. \nPer Definition hat nur der anfängliche Autor den Quellcode vor seiner \nBewertung gelesen. Der Quellcode, der einige Konventionen einhält, ist \nfür die anderen verständlicher und folglich wird das \nFehlerermittlungsverfahren leichter. \n\nSie reduzieren die Komplexität: Je komplexer ein Softwarewerk ist,\ndesto wahrscheinlicher ist, Fehler zu haben. Die richtigen \nKodierungskonventionen helfen bei der Auffindung dieser Fehler und bei der\nQuellcodekomplexitätsreduzierung.\n\nVerbesserte Entwicklungsschnelligkeit und bessere Gruppenarbeit: \nEntwickler brauchen nicht immer von Grund auf neu  anzufangen und sie haben \neine solide Basis für die Softwareentwicklung, während gleichzeitig die\nKodierungskonventionen zur Reduzierung der überflüssigen Diskussionen über\nunwichtige Fragen beitragen, und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen den\nEntwicklern erleichtern.\n\n\nEndlich werden die Felder, die von der Wahl der Kodierungskonventionen beeinflusst werden, kurz in der Grafik abgebildet.\n[3].\">Τα πεδία που επηρεάζονται από την επιλογή ενός στυλ κώδικα\n[3].\n\n1. Die strukturelle Softwarequalität bezieht sich darauf, wie die nicht funktionalen Aspekte (z.B. Kommentare, usw.), bei der Realisierung der funktionalen Aspekte helfen, wie die Programmzuverlässigkeit oder die Erleichterung der Programmwartung ([21]). ↩\n\n1Wikipedia, Coding conventions --- {W}ikipedia{,} The Free Encyclopedia, 2Wikipedia, Programming style --- {W}ikipedia{,} The Free Encyclopedia, 3Ala-Mutka, Kirsti and Uimonen, Toni and Jarvinen, Hannu-Matti, Supporting students in C++ programming courses with automatic program\n\tstyle assessment, Citeseer, 2004.4Mohan, A. and Gold, N., Programming style changes in evolving source code, Program Comprehension, 2004.

Die Weise,\nworauf man einen Variablennamen schreibt, kann uns unmittelbar informieren,\nwas dieses Element repräsentiert, wie z. B. ob eine Variable, Funktion,\nKonstant usw. ist, ohne die Registrierung dieses Elementes suchen zu müssen.\nFerner  müssen die Namen irgendeinen Sinn haben und dem Entwickler die Möglichkeit geben, den Quellcode leichter zu begreifen und zu lesen.\nEin Name, der anmutig ist, oder leicht zu tippen ist, kann später bei\njemandem Probleme hervorrufen, der den Quellcode zu verstehen. Der Quellcode wird mehrmals gelesen, aber nur einmal geschrieben. Aus diesem Grund spielt\ndie Namenskonventionen eine entscheidende Rolle und der Variablenname muss\ndie Variable, die er repräsentiert, vollends und genau beschreiben\n([1],[2],\n[3]).\nDie Namenskonventionen sind ziemlich willkürlich, und aus diesem Grund sind\ndie Konventionen, die weiter unten aufgeführt werden, eher Empfehlungen oder Konventionen, die von einem großen Entwicklerteil adoptiert worden sind, und keine Regeln. \nWas da von Bedeutung ist, ist die konsequente Einhaltung der etwaigen\nKonventionen, die gewählt worden sind, oder die ursprünglichen Schöpfer des\nQuellcodes gebraucht [3].\nGeneralnamenskonventionen ([3],[1],[4],[5],[6])\n\nEine wirksame Technik für die Auffindung repräsentativer Namen ist die\nErklärung mit Worten, was die Variable repräsentiert.\n\nDie Namen, die man wählt, müssen repräsentativ sein, so dass der Quellcode\nsofort verständlich ist. Man darf keine Abkürzungen gebrauchen, die\ndenjenigen unklar oder unbekannt sind, die den Quellcode zum ersten Mal\nlesen. Ferner darf man keine Abkürzungen durch das Streichen  von\nBuchstaben innerhalb der Wörter gebrauchen. Weiter unten folgen einige \"gute\"\nund \"schlechte\" Variablennamen.\n\n\nint price_count_reader;    // No abbreviation.\nint num_errors;            // \"num\" is a widespread convention.\nint num_dns_connections;   // Most people know what \"DNS\" stands for.\n\nint n;                     // Meaningless.\nint nerr;                  // Ambiguous abbreviation.\nint n_comp_conns;          // Ambiguous abbreviation.\nint wgc_connections;       // Only your group knows what this stands for.\nint pc_reader;             // Lots of things can be abbreviated \"pc\".\nint cstmr_id;              // Deletes internal letters.\nint temp;                  // Is it temperature? Is it temporary?\n\n\n\n\nDie Variablenlänge muss ihre Reichweite widerspiegeln. Eine Lokal-Variable\nhat eine geringe Reichweite, folglich braucht auch der Name nicht so\nbeschreibend zu sein. Im Gegenteil muss eine Global-Variable von großer\nReichweite einen repräsentativen und beschreibenden Namen haben, damit sie\nleicht zu unterscheiden ist.\n\nDie Abkürzungen und Kurzformen müssen großgeschrieben werden, wenn sie \nals Variablennamen gebraucht werden.\n\nIn der Wiederholungsschleifen müssen Namen mit bestimmter Bedeutung\ngebraucht werden, wie in den weiter unten stehenden Beispielen:\n\n\nfor (window_index = 0; window_index \n\n\n\nNamenskonventionen\nDie weiter oben Einheit erwähnt einige von den verbreitesten Regeln, die bei\nden Namenskonventionen gebraucht werden. In erster Linie werden Regeln für\ndie C++ umfasst, aber sie können auch in die übrigen Programmsprachen\nverallgemeinert werden. \nProgrammdateien\n\nFür die Programmdateien muss man einen Namen aussuchen, der den Inhalt der\nDatei widerspiegelt.\nDie Dateinamen müssen alle (in Klein-buchstaben sein) kleingeschrieben\nwerden und sie können den Unterstrich (_) oder den Oberstrich (-) umfassen. \nDie Programmdateien von C++ müssen in .cpp und von C in .c, aber die \nHeader-Dateien in .h enden. \n\nmy_useful_class.cpp\nmy-useful-class.cpp\nmyusefulclass.h\nmyusefulclass_test.h\n\n\n\nDefines & Macros\n\nDie Prozessordeklarationen und die Macros müssen in Großbuchstaben sein.\nFerner müssen die Prozessordeklarationen für die Programmdateien mit einem\nUnterstrich (_) enden.\n\n#ifndef MODULE_NAME_FILE_NAME_HPP_\n#define MODULE_NAME_FILE_NAME_HPP_\n\n// the code\n\n#endif // MODULE_NAME_FILE_NAME_HPP_\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\nDie Variablennamen (engl. Variables) sind alle in kleingeschrieben, mit\nStrichen zwischen den Wörtern.\nFür die globalen Variablen gibt es keine besonderen Ansprüche, da ihr\nGebrauch selten ist, aber wenn auf jeden Fall manche gebraucht wird, wäre es\ngut, differenziert zu werden, indem man ein g_ oder irgendein anderes Merkmal\nvoranstellt, das sie von den Lokal-Variablen differenziert. \n\nstring table_name;  // OK - uses underscore.\n\nstring tableName;   // Bad - mixed case.\n\nint g_a_global_variable;\n\n\n\nFunktionen\n\nDie Funktionen (Engl. functions) müssen camelCased1 sein und die\nVariablen müssen  kleingeschrieben  sein, mit Unterstrich zwischen den\nWörtern.\nDer Rückgabetyp jeder Funktion muss in eine andere Zeile gesetzt werden.\nMan muss ein Verb als Namen auswählen,  das die Funktionstätigkeit\nreflektiert. Man sollte Namen auswählen/es sollten Namen gewählt werden, die\ndie Problemelemente reflektieren und nicht die Problemlösung. \n\nint\napplyExample (int example_arg);\n\nvoid\ncheckForErrors();\n\n\n\nTypennamen\n\nDie Typennamen (Engl. Type names) sind CamelCased. Das heißt, dass sie mit\neinem Großbuchstaben anfangen und auch jedes neue Wort mit einem\nGroßbuchstaben anfangen muss, ohne dass ein Unterstrich (_) davor steht.\n\n// classes and structs\nclass UrlTable \n{ ...\n\nclass UrlTableTester \n{ ...\n\nstruct UrlTableProperties \n{\n  string name;\n  int num_entries;\n}\n\n// typedefs\ntypedef hash_map PropertiesMap;\n\n// enums\nenum UrlTableErrors \n{ ...\n\n\n\nStrukturen\n\nDie Glieder/Teile einer Struktur müssen als normale Lokalvariablen\naufgeschrieben werden.\n\nstruct UrlTableProperties \n{\n  string name;\n  int num_entries;\n}\n\n\n\nEnum\n\nDie Glieder der Aufzählungen (Engl. enumerations) müssen großgeschrieben\nsein, mit Strichen zwischen den Wörtern.

Wenn man die Breite\nmit einem Unterstrich markiert, macht man die Klassenvariablen-trennung \nder gebrauchten  Lokal-Variablen leichter.\n\n\nclass ExampleClass\n{\n    public:\n    ...\n    protected: \n    ... \n\n    private:\n    int example_name_; \n\n}\n\n\n\nKlassen (2)\n\nEine Klasse muss in einer Header-Datei (Engl. header file) deklariert\nund in einer Quelldatei (Engl. source file) definiert werden, deren Dateinamen so wie die Klassennamen dieselben  sind, so dass die Auffindung\nder entsprechenden Dateien leichter ist. Die Header-Datei muss eine\nSchnittstelle deklarieren und die Quelldatei muss sie realisieren.\nDie Dateien, die die Klassen realisieren, haben die Endung .hpp .\nDie Abfragefunktion (Engl. aceessors,mutators) oder Funktionen get und set) müssen mit dem Variablennamen gleich sein, auf den sie sich beziehen\n\nclass ExampleClass\n{\n  public:\n  ...\n  int \n  getNumEntries() const \n  { \n    return num_entries_; \n  }\n\n  void \n  setNumEntries (int num_entries) \n  { \n    num_entries_ = num_entries; \n  }\n\n  protected: \n  ... \n\n  private:\n  int num_entries_;\n  int example_name_; \n\n}\n\n\n\nUnterordner\nIn weiter unten wird die typische Ordnerstruktur eines typischen Programms\npräsentiert.

Στο παρακάτω πρόγραμμα φαίνεται ένα ακριβώς τέτοιο παράδειγμα στο\nοποίο έχουν ενσωματωθεί \"μαγικοί αριθμοί\" μέσα στον πηγαίο κώδικα. \n#include \n\n/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */\nint\nmain()\n{\n  int fahr;\n\n  for (fahr = 0; fahr \n\n\n\nΑντιθέτως στο παρακάτω πρόγραμμα που πλέον οι αριθμοί μέσα στο πηγαίο κώδικα\nέχουν αντικατασταθεί από μεταβλητές φαίνεται ξεκάθαρα η χρησιμότητα τους.\n#include \n#define LOWER 0 /* lower limit of table */\n#define UPPER 300 /* upper limit */\n#define STEP 20 /* step size */\n\n/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */\nint\nmain()\n{\n  int fahr;\n\n  for (fahr = LOWER; fahr \n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License."},"general_programming_practices/comparison.html":{"url":"general_programming_practices/comparison.html","title":"Σύγκριση με βάση το αριστερό μέλος","keywords":"","body":"Σύγκριση με βάση το αριστερό μέλος ([1],[2], [3])\nΣτις γλώσσες προγραμματισμού που χρησιμοποιούν διαφορετικά σύμβολα για την\nανάθεση τιμής (συνήθως ένα σύμβολο ίσον (=) ) και για την σύγκριση \n(συνήθως δύο ίσον (==) ) (π.χ. C/C++, Java και η πλειοψηφία των γλωσσών \nτα τελευταία 15 χρόνια), και όπου οι αναθέσεις τιμών είναι συντακτικά \nσωστές μέσα σε δομές ελέγχου ή επαναληπτικούς βρόχους υπάρχει ένα\nπλεονέκτημα στην υιοθέτηση της σύγκρισης με βάσης το αριστερό μέρος και \nτην τοποθέτηση των σταθερών ή των εκφράσεων προς τα αριστερά σε κάθε\nσύγκριση.\nΣτα επόμενα προγράμματα φαίνονται τα πλεονεκτήματα της υιοθέτησης της\nσύγκρισης με βάση το αριστερό μέλος. Και στις δύο περιπτώσεις θέλουμε να\nσυγκρίνουμε την τιμή του a με το 42. Στο πρώτο πρόγραμμα δεν υπάρχει κάποια\nδιαφορά μιας και στις δύο περιπτώσεις η σύγκριση πραγματοποιείται σωστά.\nif (a == 42) { ... }  // A right-hand comparison checking if a equals 42.\nif (42 == a) { ... } // Recast, using the left-hand comparison style.\n\n\n\nΗ διαφορά και το πλεονέκτημα της σύγκρισης με βάση το αριστερό μέρος\nπροκύπτει όταν ένας προγραμματιστής πληκτρολογήσει = αντί για ==.\nif (a = 42) { ... }  // Inadvertent assignment which is often hard to debug\nif (42 = a) { ... } // Compile time error indicates source of error\n\n\n\n\nΣτην πρώτη περίπτωση λοιπόν η τιμή του a θα αλλάξει σε 42, με αποτέλεσμα ο\nκώδικας μέσα στην δομή ελέγχου if να εκτελείται πάντα και καθώς\nη έκφραση αυτή είναι συντακτικά σωστή, το σφάλμα μπορεί να περάσει\nαπαρατήρητο από το προγραμματιστή, και το λογισμικό μπορεί να κυκλοφορήσει\nμε σφάλμα. Αντιθέτως στην δεύτερη περίπτωση θα έχουμε σφάλμα κατά την\nμεταγλώττιση του προγράμματος, καθώς δεν μπορούμε να αναθέσουμε τιμές σε\nαριθμητικές τιμές. Επομένως το σφάλμα θα διορθωθεί σίγουρα.\n1Wikibooks, Computer Programming/Coding Style, 2Deitel, P.J. and Deitel, H.M., C++: How to Program, Prentice Hall PTR, 2011.3Programming Research Group and others, High-Integrity C++ Coding Standard Manual: Version 3.3, 2013.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License."},"conclusion.html":{"url":"conclusion.html","title":"Εφαρμογή και συμπεράσματα","keywords":"","body":"Εφαρμογή και συμπεράσματα\nΑντί επιλόγου προτιμήθηκε να γραφτεί ένα πρότυπο προγράμματος το οποίο\nσυνοψίζει όλες τις παραπάνω οδηγίες.
